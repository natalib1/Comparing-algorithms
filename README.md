# Comparing-algorithms
Realization of data structure

java

Project's target:

This project is a "mini-research" designed to compare the performance of two solutions to the problem of finding and sorting k smallest organs out of n data organs:

• Solution A: Sorting the organs by building a minimum pile and then removing the minimal organs from the stack

• Solution B: Find the smallest k and quantify the organs in front of it

The size of the array (n) is determined by the user and k, the number of small objects to be displayed, is also determined by the user.

The values in the array are determined by the user's decision: either by the user or randomly.

Output:

• k The smallest organs are sorted

• The number of comparisons made by an algorithm between the elements of the array
